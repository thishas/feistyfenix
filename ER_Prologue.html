            <h2>The Rise of Feisty Fenix</h2>
            <div class="prologue-paragraph">
                <p>New Luma City never slept, but Sector 7 was its most restless child—a chaotic maze of flickering neon, makeshift structures, and lives held together by raw grit. Beneath the dim glow of malfunctioning streetlights, Fenix moved like a shadow, her sharp eyes scanning for both threats and opportunities. Her movements were fluid, deliberate, and calculated.</p>
                <p>“Fenix!” A boy’s voice pierced through the hum of the streets.</p>
                <p>She turned sharply to see a wiry kid leaning against a graffiti-covered wall. Behind him, a cluster of younger children huddled around a makeshift fire, their faces half-lit by the flickering flames.</p>
                <p>“What’s up, Zig?” Fenix asked as she crouched to his level.</p>
                <p>“Just keeping an eye on the little ones,” Zig replied with a grin that was too confident for his age.</p>
                <p>“Good,” she said, ruffling his messy hair affectionately. “Stick together. You know how it gets out here.”</p>
                <p>Zig straightened his back. “They still talk about what you did to that Black Band guy. One punch.”</p>
                <p>“Two punches,” Fenix corrected with a smirk. “But yeah, he went down.”</p>
                <p>The group erupted into laughter—a rare moment of joy in a city drowning in shadows. Yet above their laughter, something split through the night sky.</p>
                <p>At first, it appeared as a streak of light burning across the heavens like a falling star. But as it grew brighter—blazing and erratic—it became clear that this was no celestial phenomenon. It was massive, unnatural, and hurtling straight toward New Luma City.</p>
                <p>The Black Horizon was falling.</p>
                <p>Once hailed as a marvel of human and alien engineering, the ship now plummeted like a dying beast engulfed in flames. Metal and debris rained through the atmosphere in a fiery cascade of destruction, its trajectory carving an inevitable path toward the city below.</p>
                <p>Fenix’s breath caught in her throat as dread settled over her. She had seen this ship before—not in reality but in dreams or visions buried deep within her mind. And now it was here, crashing before her eyes.</p>
                <p>Without hesitation, she ran—not away from the wreckage but toward it. The heat intensified as she neared the perimeter of destruction, forcing her to shield her face from waves of fire and smoke. Amidst the chaos stood an opening—a breach in the hull that remained intact despite the devastation.</p>
                <p>Her pulse pounded. Something inside urged her forward. Go inside. You must.</p>
                <p>Before doubt could take hold, she climbed through the wreckage, slipping past twisted beams and scorched metal. The deeper she ventured into the ruins, the stronger the pull became. The whispers in her mind swelled into an overwhelming hum.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Onboard the Black Horizon</h3>
            <div class="prologue-paragraph">
                <p>The command chamber was a storm of chaos. Red warning lights pulsed against the thick smoke swirling through the air. The ship groaned, its structure tearing apart as alarms screamed their final warnings.</p>
                <p>Fenix stumbled forward, gripping a railing as another violent lurch nearly threw her off balance. She had made it inside—but how did she know where to go? Her head spun with an overwhelming sense of déjà vu that defied reason.</p>
                <p>The whispers returned.</p>
                <p>Control it… harness it… like cold metal against your skin.</p>
                <p>They wove through her mind like tendrils of smoke—tempting and insidious.</p>
                <p>“No,” she whispered firmly, clenching her jaw against their pull.</p>
                <p>Another explosion rocked the ship. Fenix hit the ground hard but forced herself to rise again. Somewhere nearby, a desperate voice crackled over the comms.</p>
                <p>“Captain! We have to evacuate!”</p>
                <p>Steadying herself against another tremor, Fenix responded with unwavering resolve: “No evacuation,” she said coldly. “We finish what we started.”</p>
                <p>But it seemed that the ship had other plans.</p>
                <p>The hull screamed as it began to split open, exposing its interior to the vacuum of space. The Black Horizon was unraveling—its once-mighty structure succumbing to destruction’s relentless grip.</p>
                <p>The whispers surged louder now.</p>
                <p>Let us take control. You can survive this.</p>
                <p>For a fleeting moment, Fenix hesitated—the power they offered was intoxicating—but deep down she knew its cost.</p>
                <p>“No,” she growled through gritted teeth.</p>
                <p>Tearing herself away from their influence, she sprinted toward what she hoped were escape pods as chaos consumed everything around her.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Ground Zero: New Luma City</h3>
            <div class="prologue-paragraph">
                <p>The impact shattered New Luma City like glass under pressure. Fires erupted across multiple blocks as shockwaves tore through streets already teetering on collapse. Smoke and debris choked the air while twisted metal and shards of prismatic energy lay scattered like remnants of a broken world.</p>
                <p>From within the wreckage emerged something unnatural—tendrils of bioluminescent energy pulsing rhythmically from its core. The eerie glow cast strange shadows across Sector 7’s ruins.</p>
                <p>Fenix stood at the edge of destruction; her breath caught in her throat as an unseen force called to her once more—a dull yet insistent pulse emanating from within the debris.</p>
                <p>Drawn forward despite herself, she moved cautiously toward what appeared to be a glowing orb nestled among scorched wreckage. Its light flickered faintly yet persistently like a heartbeat waiting to be answered.</p>
                <p>Her hand moved involuntarily toward it.</p>
                <p>The moment her fingers brushed its surface, searing pain shot through her veins like wildfire. Her mind fractured under an onslaught of visions—alien landscapes stretched endlessly before towering figures; symbols both incomprehensible yet deeply familiar burned into her consciousness; voices screamed in languages unspoken yet understood.</p>
                <p>Darkness enveloped her entirely.</p>
                <p>Flashes followed—distant voices shouting indistinctly; acrid smoke filling her lungs; pavement scraping against her skin as she was dragged or stumbled forward—she couldn’t tell which anymore.</p>
                <p>Through half-lidded eyes clouded by exhaustion and confusion, neon lights flickered hazily above Sector 7’s ruins. Somewhere in this haze she thought she heard Zig calling out for her before everything faded again into silence.</p>
                <p>A voice in her head, layered and alien, whispered: “You are not alone.” The orbs light pulsed, a promise and a threat.</p>
